// You have a stack of n boxes, with widths W1, heights h1, and depths d1.The
// boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each
// box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, height,
// and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible
// stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.
